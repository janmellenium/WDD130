    <p>Mabuhay!</p>
    <p>Let me introduce who am I.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 25px;">I am a working student who are living alone in the center or Metro Manila. 
        <br> is such a really hard life top begin with but I am still doing what I can to survive alone no matter what. 
        <br> I am currently an Appeals Analyst in a BPO Company assisting CVS Aetna Insurance.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 25px;">I have been a member of <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints</a> for about seven years now.
        <br> I am the only member in my family it is also the reason why my family disowned me. 
        <br> Yet, I am still trying to be the best version of myself working in <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/details/manila-philippines-temple?lang=eng">Manila Philippines Temple</a> twice a week.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 25px;">As a mental health advocate I want to be more open of what my true challenges right now. 
        <br>I am suffering from depressive disorder and clinical anxiety, and I am afraid that the root cause is I have ADHD that is why I have a plan to be rediagnosed again.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 25px;">I am hoping that we can all have best experience this semester if you wanted to connect with me please click the icons below.</p>
